# VSCode Configuration for Business Central

## What is this?
This is my custom Visual Studio Code setup that I use to develop extensions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## How to apply this configuration
1. Open VS Code  
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)  
3. Type "Open Settings (JSON)" and select that option  
4. Copy and paste the content from the `settings.json` file in this repository  
5. Save the file

You can also copy the file directly to:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`  
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`  
- Linux: `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
